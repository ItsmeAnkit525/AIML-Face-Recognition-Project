# AIML Face Recognition Project

This repository contains a Python project that implements a face recognition system using AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language). The project includes a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter and utilizes a MySQL database for storing face data.

## Features

- Face detection and recognition: The system uses computer vision techniques to detect and recognize faces in real-time.
- Graphical User Interface (GUI): The project includes a user-friendly GUI built with Tkinter, allowing easy interaction with the system.
- AIML Integration: The AIML language is used to enhance the system's ability to understand and respond to user inputs.
- MySQL Database: The system utilizes a MySQL database to store face data, allowing for efficient retrieval and management of face records.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version X.X.X)
- OpenCV (version X.X.X)
- Tkinter (version X.X.X)
- MySQL Connector/Python (version X.X.X)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/ItsmeAnkit525/AIML-Face-Recognition-Project.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd aiml-face-recognition
```

3. Install the required dependencies using pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Configure the MySQL database connection:
   - Open the `config.ini` file and provide the necessary details for your MySQL database connection (host, port, username, password, database name).
   - Save and close the file.

## Usage

To run the face recognition system, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that your webcam is properly connected to your computer.

2. Execute the following command to start the application:
```
python main.py
```

3. The GUI window will appear, providing options for face enrollment, face recognition, and other functionalities. Follow the instructions on the screen to interact with the system.

4. Enjoy the face recognition system! You can enroll new faces, recognize existing ones, and explore the different features of the application.
